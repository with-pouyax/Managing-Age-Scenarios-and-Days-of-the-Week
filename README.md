# Managing Age Scenarios and Days of the Week
 
In my JavaScript code, I begin by declaring a variable age using the var keyword and set it to the number 10. Subsequently, I implement an if-else structure to handle different age scenarios based on the value of the age variable.

If age is greater than or equal to 65, the program logs: "You get your income from your pension."
In the "else if" block, I check if age is less than 65 and greater than or equal to 18. If true, it logs: "Each month you get a salary."
Another "else if" block checks if age is under 18. If true, it logs: "You get an allowance."
Finally, there's an "else" statement capturing any other value. It logs: "The value of the age variable is not numerical."
Feel free to adjust the age variable and run the program to observe different outputs based on the age conditions.

Additionally, I've coded a days-of-the-week program using a switch statement. I define a new variable named day and set its value to "Sunday." The switch statement evaluates the day variable, with cases for each day of the week.

Inside each case, there's a placeholder console.log('Do something'), representing activities for each day. Remember, you can later change 'Do something' for each day to your desirable activity. The switch statement includes a default case logging 'There is no such day' at the end.
